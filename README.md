# challenge-3

I completed this assignment as a part of my bootcamp challenge!

## Description

In this challenge, I was provided the starter code but had to a few things to make it work! I had to create a function that displayed a series of prompts for the user to input their employees. Once the user finished inputting an employee, it gives them an toption to enter another one of cancel. This is the collectEmployees function. Once the user inputs the employees, I made an array of all the inputted employees, and wrote a function that calculated the average salary from the employees that the user put into the array. I also wrote a function that selected a random employee from the array with a math.random that selected a random winner!
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation behind making this project was to further develop my JavaScript and problem solving skills! I feel like this challenge was hard and the fact I got through it made me see I have what it takes to learn. I also learned how to properly google and search for things that can help me throughout my career. I learned a lot about making functions and arrays. Overall, I think this challenge was very useful in developing my Javascript, problem-solving, and googling skills!
